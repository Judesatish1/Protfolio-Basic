# Protfolio-Basic

This is a basic personal portfolio website built using HTML and CSS, consisting of two main pages:

Home Page – Introduces who I am, including a short bio, title, and navigation menu.

Projects Page – Showcases selected projects with brief descriptions and simple styling.

The website is fully static, cleanly structured, and responsive across devices. It's ideal for showcasing personal or professional work with minimal design and no external frameworks.
